In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces.</p><p>Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>"
